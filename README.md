# Concept

A simple space trading game in the style of the original Elite.

# TODO

## Generate the map
	
	* populate it with star systems
	* decide resource scarcity for each
	* set market prices
	* simulate govenment, natural disasters, resource mining operations, etc

# Markets

	* bonds / ZC bonds
	* stocks / equities
	* options
	* futures
	* indices
	* ETF (Exchange Traded Funds)
	* commodities

# Ships

	* base ships
	* extend with guns, better drives, improved AI, longer range communications
	* robots for unloading

# Trade Hubs

Since it's costly to enter a gravity well of any decent size most trading will be done with orbital platforms, captive asteroids, wrecks of massive ships, etc.

Each trade hub will have one or more markets, probably just the one to simplify the game code a bit.

# Trade Parameters

You can go fast or you can go cheap, but you can't go both. Fuel burns at the start and end of journeys will need to be factored into the price of goods.

Ships that are unmanned are preferred since this allows them to accelerate for long periods at multiples of gravity without killing the people in them. Slave ships are an obvious exception to this and will account for some part of the very high price of slaves.

Random encounters by pirates and space debris might cause shifts in the markets due to shortages of goods.

Supply and demand will play a part in market rates.

Planets might be better suited to organic materials than space stations.

There is no such thing as artificial gravity or faster than light travel. Single exception is the quantum entangled bits that form a part of their galactic wide internet. A new receiver has to be delivered to the region the slow way first in order to achieve this faster than light transmission of information. Bandwidth is limited and costly.
